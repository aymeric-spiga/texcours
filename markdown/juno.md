+
+The primary motivation for the Juno mission is to improve our understanding of the history of our solar system.
+
+
+Jupiter was likely the first of the planets to form around our sun because it contains a lot of the same light gases that the sun is 
made of -- hydrogen and helium. After the first few million years in the sun's life, an intense solar wind was generated that blew awa
y most of the light gases remaining from the original stellar nursery. For Jupiter to be primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, it
 must have formed while there were still a lot of those light gases around -- when the solar system was young.
+
+Since Jupiter is mainly made of the same material as the original solar nebula, the gas giant is thought to hold clues about the sola
r system's early history. Although people have been studying Jupiter for hundreds of years, many basic questions about the gas giant p
lanet remain.
+
+In 1995, NASA's Galileo mission made the voyage to Jupiter. One of its jobs was to drop a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere. The data r
eturned from that probe showed us that Jupiter's composition was different than scientists thought, indicating that our theories of pl
anetary formation were wrong. Even with all the things we learned from Galileo and other studies over the past couple of decades, Jupi
ter still hides many mysteries beneath its swirling clouds:
+
+    How did Jupiter form?
+
+    How much water or oxygen is in Jupiter?
+
+    What is the structure inside Jupiter?
+
+    Does Jupiter rotate as a solid body, or is the rotating interior made up of concentric cylinders?
+
+    Is there a solid core, and if so, how large is it?
+
+    How is its vast magnetic field generated?
+
+    How are atmospheric features related to the movement of the deep interior?
+
+    What are the physical processes that power the auroras?
+
+    What do the poles look like?
+
+Juno's primary goal is to reveal the story of Jupiter's formation and evolution. The spacecraft will observe the planet's gravity and
 magnetic fields, atmospheric dynamics and composition, and the complex coupling between the interior, atmosphere and magnetosphere th
at determines the planet's properties and drives its evolution. In addition to vastly improving our knowledge of Jupiter itself, as th
e archetype of gas giant planets, Jupiter will provide the knowledge to help us understand the origins of planetary systems around oth
er stars.
+
+To accomplish its science objectives, Juno will orbit over Jupiter’s poles and pass very close to the planet. Juno needs to get extre
mely close to Jupiter to make the very precise measurements the mission is after. This orbital path carries the spacecraft repeatedly 
through hazardous radiation belts, while avoiding the most powerful (and hazardous) radiation belts. Jupiter’s radiation belts are ana
logous to Earth’s Van Allen belts -- but far more deadly.

+
+The spacecraft will orbit Jupiter 37 times, with de-orbit into Jupiter at the end of the last orbit. During the almost one-and-a-half
-year science phase of the mission, the spacecraft will execute a close flyby above the planet’s cloud tops every 14 days.
+
+All of Juno’s science instruments will be on during all 32 science orbits. However, all Juno science orbits are not created equal. So
me orbits will find Juno flying past the planet in an orientation that best highlights Juno’s Microwave Radiometer (MWR) instrument. O
ther orbits have Juno flying past Jupiter in an orientation that favors Juno’s gravity science (GRAV) experiment.
+
+During an MWR orbit, Juno’s Infrared imager/spectrometer (JIRAM) and JunoCam will be collecting their best data of the mission becaus
e during those orbits, the spacecraft spin axis is oriented to get the best view of the planet directly below (nadir). The gravity sci
ence experiment during MWR orbits will still operate, although only with the X-Band instrument. The Ka-band Translator (KaT) that is p
art of the gravity experiment is turned off during MWR orbits because it requires the spacecraft to be in an Earth-pointed orientation
.
+
+During orbits that highlight gravity experiments (GRAV), Juno is in an Earth-pointed orientation that sllows the Ka-Band Translator t
o downlink data in real-time to Earth. However, this Earth-pointed orientation reduces the quantity of MWR, JIRAM and JunoCam data col
lection.
